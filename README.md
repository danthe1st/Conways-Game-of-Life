an Instance of Conway's Game Of Life made with JavaFX

Conway's Game Of Life is a 2D-grid by John Horton Conway.  
Every Cell can have 2 states: alive or dead.  
## Rules
* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies in the next generation, as if by under population.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies in the next generation, as if by overpopulation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell in the next generation, as if by reproduction.
